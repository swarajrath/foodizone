## üè≠ Contribute

This is one of my side projects which I made to learn the following:

- React (Fundamentals)
- Context API (For state management)
- Tailwind CSS (An utility first CSS Framework)
- Material UI (A set of pre-made react components)
- And many little _reacty_ things...

So, if you're into any of those or want to go into in future, **this project is dedicated to you.** Give this a ‚≠ê if you liked!

And of course, this couldn't have been possible without the great _free to use_ API called, **MealDB**. You can give that a look on [here](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).
